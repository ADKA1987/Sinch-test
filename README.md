## Problem 3
  It is same as the second problem but I used Spring boot with java 11, to run the application you can chose use any Ide after importing the project as Maven, or you can use the following command:
  1. run: 
  ```
  mvn clean install
  ```
  2. Navigate to the target folder and run:

```
java -jar problem3-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```
  3. Then you can open any broswer and open:
